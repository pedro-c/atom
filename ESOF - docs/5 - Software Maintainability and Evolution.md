## Software Maintainability

What is Software Maintainability?
>Software maintainability is defined as the degree to which an application is understood, repaired, or enhanced. Software maintainability is important because it is approximately 75% of the cost related to a project!

To discuss atom software maintainability, we use SIG metrics. There are eight different metrics. To measure how atom software does in relation to this metrics we use [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). These are the results:
1. Write short units of code:
2. Write simple units of code;
3. Write code once;
4. Keep unit interfaces small;
5. Separate concerns in modules;
6. Couple architecture components loosely;
7. Keep architecture components balanced;
8. Keep your codebase small;
9. Automate tests;
10. Write clean code;
