## Project description - Atom

Atom is a modern and acessible text editor, plus, it is capable of letting the user costumize it or being used in a productive way without the need of changing the configuration.

### Activity


Currently,(16/10/2016), Atom has **1736 'closed issues'**, **1815 'open issues'** e **4407 'forks'**.
The 'pull requests' are closed approximately in 19 hours and the issues in 1 day.
Atom also has **73,016 'commits'** done by **1,870 contribuitors** representing 423,340 lines of code.

The package 'language-html', has nowadays, **106 'closed issues'**, **37 'open issues'** e **86 'forks'**.

### Atom packages
  Our idea is to support a core package of Atom, [languague-html](https://atom.io/packages/language-html) (GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/atom/language-html)). This package enables the recognition of HTML language, syntax highlighting, and many others. However, this package does not own an auto-close of html tags, being this, the primary feature found in other text editors (ex: Sublime Text Editor). We consider the implementation of this feature important, because it allows a far more productive programming.

## Process Development
  Software development on open source (FLOSS - Free/Libre and Open Source Software)	

  In the center circle you can find the core developers, who contribute with a big portion of the code and supervise the desing and project evolution. In the next circle we face the co-developers. These are responsible for the submission of patches, trough pull requests, like per example, error correction which then are reviwed and approved by the core developers. Furthermore, we have the active users, whose contribuition is based not on code but in the frequent error detection and aspects to improve. Finally we have the passive users, those who are limite to using the program without sharing their say about the project.

### Iterative and Incremental Development

  The project uses the "Iterative and Incremental Development" model. This process is based on projects development trough iterations. The growth of the project trough iterations means that the development is cut into smaller pieces, little projects, turning the growth gradual. The Atom packages are small projects that follow this process. So, the problems are cut into smaller parts, to reduce the complexity of the development. This way, it turns easier to reach a resolution for the problems found by the users.




### Opinions, Critics e Alternatives

   There are currently 1742 open issues, all prepared for all levels of knowledge of programming. You can find these identified with tags, per example, "beginner", allows less experient programmers to give their contribuition among many others like "help-wanted" to more advanced contribuitors.

   Atom has a ["Flight Manual"](http://flight-manual.atom.io/), that allows any developer the possibility of contribuiting and easily understanding the structure that composes Atom.

   This manual, which explains the basic structure of the Atom functioning, per example, what files of cofiguration it reads when it stars, it also explains how to create and modify existing packages.

   The fact that Atom is organized in packages, it makes the constant developing of its various components much easier without the need to launch new versions constantly. Per example, if we want to add new functionalities to the HTML language support, we just need to access the package of this language, which is easily distribuited to the rest o of the users. This would turn much more complex and hard working in case it was necessary to edit Atom completely for any small improvement.

   This packages division allows Atom to keep it self a light text editor, giving the user the possibility of installing only its extensions, according to his needs.

#### Alternatives

  One alternative for the Atom development would be to make it private and close it from the open-source community. This way it would be possible to win money out of it, altough the number of developers would be a lot smaller, making the grouth much slower and conservative .

  Other alternative would be for it not to be organized by packages, giving it a much heavier distribuiton and causing the launch of the program to be slower and incresing the space occupied by new versions.
